This guide is only for the Lenovo ThinkPad T480. I am NOT responsible for any harm you cause to your device. This guide is provided "as-is" and all steps taken are done at your own risk.

&nbsp;

## üìù To-Do
These features will be implemented in a future update:

- [X] macOS Ventura support
- [ ] Touchscreen support

&nbsp;

## üöß macOS Ventura Support

> **Warning**
> macOS Ventura is still in Beta! I do not recommend this for productive use!

In version 1.2.0, support for macOS Ventura was added. To update your system to Ventura, the following steps must be performed:

1. Replace your current OpenCore configuration with `EFI - Ventura`. See `‚ôªÔ∏è Upgrade macOS / Switch EFI` for more infos.

2. Enroll your device to the Developer Seed. Use `macOS Developer Beta Access Utility` from your Apple Developer Account or by typing the following command into the Terminal: `/System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/Seeding.framework/Versions/Current/Resources/seedutil enroll DeveloperSeed`

3. Download macOS Ventura via Software Update. Create a offline installer or simply update.


### Tested Builds
- [X] Developer Beta 1 `(22A5266r)` 
- [X] Developer Beta 2 `(22A5286j)`
- [X] Developer Beta 3 `(22A5295h & 22A5295i)`
- [X] Developer Beta 4 `(22A5311f)`
- [X] Developer Beta 5 `(22A5321d)`

These are the Hardware component I use. But this OpenCore configuation <strong>should still work</strong> with your device, even if the components are not equal.

> **Note** Check the model of your WiFi & Bluetooth card. Intel cards should be compatible with itlwm (or AirportItlwm). If your card is from another manufacturer, please check if your card supports macOS.

| Category  | Component                            |

## Installation
You can find the Installation guide [here.](https://hackintosh.vnxy.one)

<details>  
<summary><strong>‚ôªÔ∏è Upgrade macOS / Switch EFI</strong></summary>
</br>

If you plan to upgrade your macOS (or updating the EFI / switching to HeliPort), you'll need a different OpenCore configuation (EFI). Please follow these steps:

> Note: Download the desired macOS version in the Settings before following these steps, if you are connected via WiFi.

1. Download the newest release & [ProperTree](https://github.com/corpnewt/ProperTree) and extract it.
2. Start ProperTree and load the ```Config.plist``` on your EFI partition. (File -> Open)
> Note: You can mount your EFI partition by pressing ```ALT + SPACE```, typing Terminal and enter the following command: ```sudo diskutil mountDisk disk0s1```.
3. Now also load the new configuration file from the repo for the desired macOS installation (or HeliPort config). 
4. You should now have 2 ProperTree-windows open on your screen.
5. Go in both windows to ```Root -> PlatformInfo -> Generic```. Transfer ```MLB, ROM, SystemProductName, SystemSerialNumber and SystemUUID``` to the new config. 
6. Save the new config (File -> Save) and close both windows.
7. Now delete your existing EFI folder from the EFI partition and copy the new one to it. (Make sure that the Directorys ```Boot and OC``` are in ```EFI```).

If you want to upgrade macOS, download the desired macOS version in the Settings app and perform the upgrade like on a real Mac.
